### Unsupervised Machine Learning on Uber NY Dataset

## Project Goal
We will use Unsupervised Machine Learning to create a recommendation algorithm on where Uber drivers in New York should be to maximize their chances of finding a ride.


## Deliverables

- Clean, well-commented code
- Clean data with EDA
- Unsupervised ML modeling with KMeans, using Elbow method
- Vizualisation map using Folium library
- Models implementation and comparison
